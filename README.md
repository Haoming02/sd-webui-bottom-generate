# SD Webui Moar Generate
This is an Extension for the [Automatic1111 Webui](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui), 
which adds another **Generate** button, 
for when you have too many Extensions active but don't wanna scroll all the way up every single time... 

By default, it adds the button to the bottom of the page.
You can also edit the `.js` file to change the setting and move the button under **Result** instead.
