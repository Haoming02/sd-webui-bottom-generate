# SD Webui Moar Generate
This is an Extension for the [Automatic1111 Webui](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui) which adds another **Generate** button, 
for when you have too many Extensions active but don't wanna scroll all the way up every single time... 

## Setting
You can right click the `.js` file, click **Edit**, then modify the following line to select between different options:

- `static option = x`
  > Replace **x** with:

  - **0**: Add the button at the bottom of the page
  - **1**: Add the button under the generated result
  - **2**: Add the button at the fixed bottom right corner
