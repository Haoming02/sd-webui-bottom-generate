# SD Webui Moar Generate
This is an Extension for the [Automatic1111 Webui](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui) which adds another **Generate** button, 
for when you have too many Extensions active but don't wanna scroll all the way up every single time... 

## Setting
You can switch between different modes in the `User interface` section of the **Settings**:
- **Bottom**: Add the button at the bottom of the page
- **Result**: Add the button under the generated result
- **Floating**: Add the button to the fixed bottom right corner
